# AngularSeed

AngularSeed is a very simple app that you can understand, use its structure and edit its content to satisfy your business logic and workflow.

It uses a fake backend that intercepts sent requests, it only requires changing request API URL and endpoints so you can communicate with your backend.

AngularSeed app built using angular material.

Not a big thing but it seems helpful if you want to build your app from scratch, and a good experience for me that I would like to share.
